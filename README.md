# node-react-blog
Just some tinkering to learn about node and react. Nothing fancy and nothing that hasn't already been done before. If you're looking for something interesting, maybe look elsewhere (or at least look at the source it's based on -- see link below).

If you're wondering, I followed this guide here: https://codeburst.io/build-simple-medium-com-on-node-js-and-react-js-a278c5192f47
